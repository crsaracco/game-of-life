Game of Life, inspired by /u/caleblafeve's post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/aa72q0/conways_game_of_life_wallshelf_decoration/).

I don't have the 32x32 screen that /u/caleblafeve has, but I wanted to be able to watch it anyway, so I whipped this up.

## Future

This would be a good project to try out Rust on an embedded platform. If I ever buy that 32x32 LED screen, I'll try to target some microcontroller and see how it goes.
